# Dragon Warrior Terrain Generation

Simple terrain generation in Java based on the tutorial on [PlayfulJS](http://www.playfuljs.com/realistic-terrain-in-130-lines/). This tool uses the graphic tiles from [Dragon Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmzHrNVelL0) instead of isometric projection.

## Examples

## Improvement

Could probably make sure rivers connect and make them less likely to appear alongside terrain transition points. 

It'd be cool to see some towns and caves in here. 

Add some GUI contols to refresh the display and export a doc to use in some other top down game.

# Dragon Warrior Terrain Generation

Simple terrain generation in Java based on the tutorial on [PlayfulJS](http://www.playfuljs.com/realistic-terrain-in-130-lines/). This tool uses the graphic tiles from [Dragon Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmzHrNVelL0) instead of isometric projection.

## Examples

## Improvement

It'd be cool to see some towns and caves in here. 

Add some GUI contols to refresh the display and export a doc to use in some other top down game. 

Should add water that has the coastal tiles when adjacent to land.

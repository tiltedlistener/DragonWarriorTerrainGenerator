# Dragon Warrior Terrain Generation

Simple terrain generation in Java based on the tutorial on [PlayfulJS](http://www.playfuljs.com/realistic-terrain-in-130-lines/). This tool uses the graphic tiles from [Dragon Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmzHrNVelL0) instead of isometric projection.

## Examples




## Improvement

Could probably make sure rivers connect and make them less likely to appear alongside terrain transition points. 

It'd be cool to see some towns and caves in here.
